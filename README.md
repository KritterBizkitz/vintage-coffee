Coffee Mod ☕ for Vintage Story

by KritterBizkit

Brew real coffee in Vintage Story: find wild shrubs, prune for beans, roast, grind, and brew a hot drink that actually warms you up.

Features

Wild Coffee Shrubs

Spawns in the Tropics, rainy biomes (new chunks).

Three growth states: empty → flowering → ripe.

Prune ripe shrubs to collect beans; shrubs regrow over time.

Bean Lifecycle

Green Beans → roast → Roasted Beans → grind → Coffee Grounds.

Brewing (Cookpot)

Put 1× Bowl of Water (waterportion) and 1× Coffee Grounds into the pot.

Heat until cooked, then serve into bowls.

Served hot (shows as a liquid in the bowl).

Warmth Effect

Drinking hot coffee gives an instant warmth bump and a lingering slow-cool effect (via the small CoffeeEffects code mod).
