Flowering indicates the next stage is near.\n\n<b>Finding and planting</b>\n• Explore warm zones and river valleys\n• Replant any saplings you obtain to establish a local patch\n• Bushes regrow over time; check them periodically\n\n<b>Harvesting</b>\nAt the <i>ripe</i> stage harvest to obtain <i>Green Coffee Beans</i>. These are the start of the processing chain.\n\n<b>Tips</b>\n• If your world is colder than usual, look for lower elevations or sheltered valleys\n• Traders or loot may also supply beans or saplings depending on your pack",

The result is coffee served in a bowl. It is currently <i>eaten</i> rather than drunk but still provides its benefits.\n\n<b>Path B: Barrel brew</b> <i>(bulk method)</i>\nPlace <i>Water</i> and <i>Coffee Grounds</i> into a <i>Barrel</i> then seal for about 24 in-game hours. Use ratios like <i>10 L Water + 10 Grounds</i> up to <i>50 L Water + 50 Grounds</i>. The barrel yields <i>Coffee</i> as a liquid you can store and pour.\n\n<b>Heating</b>\nFresh barrel coffee is cold. To heat it:\n1) Place a <i>Vertical Boiler</i> directly on top of a lit <i>Firepit</i>\n2) Pour in coffee from a bucket or other vessel\n3) Hover the contents and hold <i>Shift</i> to see the <b>Temperature</b> rising\nCoffee keeps its temperature when moved to other containers.\n\n<b>Serving</b>\nPour hot coffee into a <i>Tankard</i> or another drink vessel supported by your modpack. Effects in recipes or code can read temperature to give a hot bonus.\n\n<b>Quick reference</b>\n• Green → roast → grind → brew\n• Cooking Pot: 1 L Water + 1 Grounds → bowl of coffee (WIP)\n• Barrel: 10 L Water + 10 Grounds up to 50 L + 50 Grounds → bulk coffee\n• Boiler warms coffee; same item becomes hot by temperature"
